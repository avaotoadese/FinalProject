## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

**Descriptive Statistics**

-   Read in dataset & save file

-   Create a `{gtsummary}` table of descriptive statistics about your data

```{r}
install.packages("gtsummary", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")

#route and print ebola dataset 
ebola <-(here::here("data", "ebola.csv"))
ebola <- read.csv("data/ebola.csv")

#create a full descriptive table for ebola dataset
library(gtsummary)
tbl_summary(
  ebola,
  by = Country,
  include = c(Indicator, Date, value)) #too long

#create a descriptive table for ebola dataset for variables indicator and value by country
library(gtsummary)
tbl_summary(
  ebola,
  by = Country,
  include = c(Indicator, value))

```

`@tbl-one` contains descriptive statistics for the ebola dataset for all variables by Country

@tbl-two contains descriptive statistics for the ebola dataset for variables "value" and "Indicator" by Country

-   Fit a regression and present well-formatted results from the regression

```{r}
#create a regression for ebola dataset using gtsummary
tbl_uvregression(
  ebola, 
  y = value,
  include = c(Country, Indicator,
              Date, value),
  method = lm)
```
